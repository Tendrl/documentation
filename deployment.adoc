= Deploying Tendrl

This document serves as the master document that ties together the installation
of the various tendrl components. Wherever applicable, the individual
components' installation documentation has been linked to. This document
primarily talks about the deployment layout and the installation of global
components such as etcd.

Any tendrl deployment, logically, would look as depicted in the components
overview diagram below. The exact physical layout and the number of the nodes
for various deployment scenarios is discussed in the rest of the document.

== Deployment Layouts

=== Non-HA Layout

The following (physical or virtual) layout could be used for poc or development
purposes:

Tendrl Master::
* web server (apache)
* tendrl api, proxied behind the web server
* tendrl ui, served via the web server
* etcd

Storage Node::
* storage system (ceph, gluster etc.)
* tendrl node agent
* tendrl bridge (node agent will install and configure the bridge as
appropriate, depending upon the storage system)

==== Post Deployment

The following endpoints should be available for client consumption:

frontend:: http://tendrl_master_host/
api:: http://tendrl_master_host/api/1.0/


== General System Setup Considerations

=== Firewalling

Following are the defaults for various components. Ensure that they're
configured on the nodes on which these components will run, depending upon your
chosen layout.

etcd:: tcp/2379
apache:: tcp/80
api:: same as apache for production, tcp/9393 for the development server
frontend:: same as apache

=== SELinux Configuration

Tendrl does not currently support running on SELinux enabled systems. In case
there are problems running tendrl on such systems, please turn SELinux off.

Should you want to run tendrl on an SELinux enabled system, there is a specific
SELinux configuration change for apache on CentOS 7 that needs to be made. It
is covered in the
https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc#running-on-port-80[Running
on Port 80] section of the api installation documentation.


== Component Installation

=== etcd

NOTE: All the commands are run as a regular user that has `sudo` privileges.

IMPORTANT: The etcd connection details are required for deploying all the other
components.

* Install https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/tag/v2.3.7[etcd >= 2.3.x && <
3.x].
+
On CentOS 7, etcd is available in the `extras` repository.

 $ sudo yum install etcd

* By default, etcd will listed on the loopback interface. Edit the etcd
configuration file `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` to configure it to listen on the
public interface.
* Ensure that the firewall configuration allows inbound connections to etcd.
* Enable and start the service

 $ sudo systemctl enable etcd.service
 $ sudo systemctl start etcd.service


=== From Source on CentOS 7

NOTE: The definition and flow yaml files are uploaded to etcd by the node
agents upon starting up. The api application reads these yaml files and brings
up the endpoints based on them.

Node Agent::
Install the node agent on every node of the storage cluster using the
documentation at https://github.com/Tendrl/node_agent/blob/master/README.adoc.

Tendrl API::
The api installation instructions are in the
https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc[api repository].
Only follow the instructions from the sections listed below:
  . https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc#system-setup[System Setup]
  . https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc#install-tendrl-api[Install tendrl-api].
    * Install only the production dependencies if you want only to run the api.
    * Install everything if you want to also have the development setup as well.
  . https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc#configuration[Configuration].
  . https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc#running-on-port-80[Running on Port 80].

Tendrl Frontend::
+
NOTE: Currently, the frontend is served via apache using the same configuration
file that ships with and is used by the api, as discussed in Step 2 under the
https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl-api/blob/master/README.adoc#running-on-port-80[instructions
for running the api on port 80].
+
Before deployment, the frontend needs to be compiled first. The compilation
instructions are in the section `Step 2: Building from source` in the
https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl_frontend/blob/master/docs/deployment.adoc[frontend
deployment document].
+
After compilation, copy over the assets in the `dist` directory to
`/var/www/tendrl`, where apache will serve them from.

 [tendrl_frontend] $ sudo cp -r dist/* /var/www/tendrl/
+
The frontend should now be available at the root url (eg.
http://tendrl_master_host/) via apache.
