== Tendrl PR review tips

- [*] Check PR for CPU impact (long running loops, blocking calls etc)
- [*] Check for IO (disk and network, etcd/db) impact  (local files, network calls to etcd or others, etcd performance)
- [*] Check for Platform, SDS, Integrations and Tendrl security impact
- [*] Check Scalability (does the PR work in a multi node Tendrl deployment and sds cluster)
- [*] Check readability and maintainability of the code
- [*] Check packaging and infra and details introduced in the PR
- [*] Check QE impact (unit tests, functional/integration test-ability)
- [*] Check for core Tendrl logic  (does the patch adhere to Tendrl namespaces, Tendrl definitions, Tendrl data model and ops model, use of commons etc)
- [*] Check for python syntax and object oriented programming and software design principles
