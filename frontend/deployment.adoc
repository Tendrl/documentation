= Tendrl Frontend: Deployment

Tendrl frontend is a static webapp, built from a Node.js project. This document
details how to build from the source, and then how to configure the webhost to
serve the app.

== Basic Requirements

=== Minimum System Requirements

This is the bare minimal requirements for a VM to be able to run the Tendrl
frontend server. However, for performance and efficiency, more resources would
be good to avail:

* *CPU:* 1 core, 1 thread
* *RAM:* 512 MiB
* *Storage:* 10GiB
* *OS:* RHEL 7.x or similar

=== Package dependencies

* httpd or, nginx

=== Build dependencies

*Only required if building from source:*

Installed with distro's package manager: `git`, `nodejs`, `npm` +
Installed with `npm`: `gulp`, `tsd`, <add more>

== How to Deploy

To deploy Tendrl frontend, you may want to build from source, or install the
package.

* *If installing from package*, skip the "Building from source" section
* *If building from source*, likewise, skip "Installing from repo" section

TIP: This entire process should be handled by a bootstrapping script in future.

NOTE: _The commands listed here assumes latest version of Fedora in use as the
host OS, use proper substitution if your environment differ._

=== Step 1: Preparing host

==== If you're on *Fedora*
Nothing to do here, jump to next step.

==== If you're on *RHEL*
You need to register and activate your subscription with customer portal ID to
add repos and install packages. _@TODO: process details & guides._

==== If you're on *CentOS*
You need to enable EPEL repo with `yum install epel-release`

==== If you're on *Other Distro*
Follow along the next steps, and depending on distros, some processes, commands
and package names may vary.

=== Step 2: Building from source

First we need the essential packages

```sh
$ sudo dnf install -y git nodejs npm
```

Then we need the frontend source

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Tendrl/tendrl_frontend.git
$ cd tendrl_frontend
```

Next we will install the dependencies for the package to build

```sh
$ sudo npm install -g gulp tsd
$ npm install
$ tsd install
```

Lastly, the build... which is an one step process, using gulp to automate the
underlying steps

```sh
$ gulp compile
```

Once gulp finishes compiling, the build artifacts will be available in the
`dist` subdirectory within the source path.

=== Step 3: Installing from repo

_@TODO: content to be added when package details are available._

=== Step 4: Serving the application

In this step, we take the build artifacts and serve them as web contents.

_@TODO: if installed from package, depending on which all steps are covered in
the process, this section might need updating._

==== Configure firewall

For the server to be able to accept and serve external http requests, we need
to configure the firewall.

This isn't required to be the first step (and can be done after installing the
webserver), however, this is a common step for whatever webserver we choose to
go with up next.

```sh
$ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
$ sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

==== Serve using nginx

First, let's install and start `nginx`

```sh
$ sudo dnf install -y nginx
$ sudo systemctl start nginx
```

At this point, you should be able to see the default nginx webpage, by visiting
`http://<hostname.or.ip.address>/` from your browser.

Now, to serve the app content (instead of the default page) you can take either
of the 2 following ways (among many other possible, less desirable ways):

. *Easy way:* copy over app contents to nginx's default webroot
.. Backup the default pages: `$ sudo mv /usr/share/nginx/html /usr/share/nginx/default`
.. Copy over the app contents: `$ cp -r <source-path>/dist /usr/share/nginx/html`
. *Right way:* follow along https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/serving-static-content/[nginx's official documentation] on how to configure the server for serving static webapp.

---

==== Serve using httpd

Again, let's install and start Apache first

```sh
$ sudo dnf install -y httpd
$ sudo systemctl start httpd
```

At this point, you should be able to see the default httpd webpage, by visiting
`http://<hostname.or.ip.address>/` from your browser.

Now, to serve the app content (instead of the default page) you can take either
of the 2 following ways (among many other possible, less desirable ways):

. *Easy way:* copy over app contents to httpd's default webroot: `$ cp -r <source-path>/dist/* /var/www/html/`
. *Right way:* follow along https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/configuring.html[Apache's official documentation] on how to configure the server for serving static webapp.

---

If everything went well, then browsing `http://<hostname.or.ip.address>/` from
your web-browser should give you Tendrl's frontend landing page. *Congrats!*
