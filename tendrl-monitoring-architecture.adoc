= Tendrl Monitoring Overview

To observe and check the progress or quality of (something) over a period of
time is monitoring. Based on the types of resources to be monitored, it can be
classified as:

* Performance monitoring
* Status monitoring

The status monitoring can be further classified as:

* Process status monitoring
* Resource status monitoring

The essential functionalities provided by any performance moniotoring systems
are:

* Statistics collection
* Thresholding on the collected statistics
* Alerting/notifying the users about the threshold breach if any.

The essential functionalities provided by any status moniotoring systems are:

* Event listeners to listen to change in status of the resource if provided by
  the sds framework or a continous/scheduled hearbeat to monitor changes in
  status of resource.
* Alerting/notifying the users about the threshold breach if any.

In accordance with the above classifications and requirements the stack for
monitoring tendrl managed systems is as follows:

== Overview Of Components Of Monitoring Stack

=== Tendrl Performance (performance_monitoring)

It is a separate service that runs outside tendrl core stack and it relies on
the state information in tendrl’s central store for its functioning. Typically
it can be co-resident with tendrl application but nothing necessiates this.
Following are its sub-components based on the functionalities:

* Api Layer : This layer will serve the following responsibilities.
  ** Serve the time series data stored in time series database.
  ** The apis internally use a plugin based approach for querying the
     time-series performance data which eases the task of supporting multiple
     time-series databases.
* Aggregator : This module aggregates atomic stats(ex: cluster utilization) to
  composite(system utilization) stats which will be required by UI for the
  dashboards.


=== Tendrl Alerts (tendrl_alerts)

* A separate service that is installed with Tendrl App.
* It serves the following responsibilities:
  ** Watch for new alert/notification details in central store.
    *** This application utilizes the etcd's watch capability to sense changes
        in etcd.
  ** Send out alerts to users configured to receive them. Following are the
     currently supported means of notifying alerts to configured users:
    *** Email alerting:

--------
    Note: This might require users to enable access for less secure apps in
          their mail server.
--------

=== Time Series DB

* This will hold the data collected by collectd and also those aggregated by
  the aggregator
* Graphite will be used as time series db.
  ** It consists of three software components:
    *** carbon - a high-performance service that listens for time-series data
    *** whisper - a simple database library for storing time-series data
    *** graphite-web - Graphite's user interface & API for rendering graphs
        and dashboards
  ** Metrics get fed into the stack via the Carbon service, which writes data
     out to Whisper databases for long-term storage.
  ** Advantages:
    *** Graphite's web platform offers a variety of output styles and formats,
        including raw images, CSV, XML, and JSON
    *** Allows querying statistics for specific time-ranges and intervals.
    *** Allows wild cards in query paths


=== Collectd

* A ​daemon​ which collects performance statistics periodically.
* It is actively developed and supported and well documented.
* Everything in collectd is done in plugins.
  ** It comes with over 90 plugins​ and is extensible.
  ** Collectd activates those plugins that are loaded and/or configured in
     collectd’s conf files.
  ** Changes in conf files will be effected in collectd only on restart of
     the collectd daemon.
* It serves the following responsibilities:
  ** Collect the physical and logical resource utilizations using configured
     plugins.
  ** Watch for the breach of configured thresholds and trigger execution of
     custom plugin.
* Collectd comes packaged readily with a plugin to write collectd measured
  statistics onto graphite db.


Apart from the above, components of tendrl core stack also play important role
in the functioning of tendrl monitoring stack.


=== Tendrl Node Agent

* The tendrl node agent opens a socket for collectd to send threshold breach
  notifications to it.
* The node agent then puts any threshold breach message from collectd onto
  etcd.


=== Tendrl SDS-Bridge

* sds-bridge processes anything of interest to it on the node-agent exposed
  threshold notification socket.
* The sds-bridge also performs status monitoring.
  ** In case of gluster, the gluster-bridge listens to and handles the events
     that the gluster cluster provides.
  ** In case of ceph, the ceph-bridge handles state changes in ceph resources


== Generic Working Principle

* Monitoring application connects to etcd and uploads the default monitoring
  configuration and flows.
* As the final step of creating/managing an entity in tendrl, the appropriate
  collectd plugin configurations will be made on suitable nodes in accordance
  with the following:
  ** Monitoring application triggers the monitoring provisioning flow on every
     node for node monitoring via the core API.
  ** The provisioning flow for the monitoring stack installs collectd-related
     pieces on every node and generates the configuration files from templates
     shipped with the collectd plugins on nodes.
* The configured plugins start collecting the respective utilizations at every
  configured intervals of time and push them to the write destination using
  the plugin configured as write plugin.
* Parallely, every configured intervals of time the aggregator module of the
  central monitoring application will collect the instant value of stats from
  the time series db and update the stats of interest to tendrl into tendrl’s
  central store and also aggregates these stats @ cluster and system levels
  and push back these stats to time series db and also to the central store.
  These aggregations are typically inline with the UX designs/requirements.
* The alert to notification flow is as under:
  ** Node agent is responsible for transporting the alerts to etcd
  ** Process state related alerts will be gathered from systemd.
  ** Cluster state related alerts will be generated by the bridges
  ** Performance and threshold monitoring alerts are generated by the collectd
     using the collectd's threshold plugin and in accordance with configured
     thresholds.
  ** One socket is connected to for writes from collectd, read-only from the
     node agent and read-write from the bridge
  ** Any alert on that socket is always taken to etcd by the node agent
  ** Bridge can read the alerts and act on only the ones it can act on, ignore
     the rest it can also generate it's own alerts and put them on the socket
     for node agent to transport to etcd
  ** The alerting application will be responsible for:
    *** Watching alerts in etcd's /alerts directory and sending out mails or
        sms or snmp traps.
    *** Invoke the tendrl api callback to notify tendrl api of a new alert
        (and then the tendrl api will notify it to ui).
* Any queries for time series database will be served by the tendrl api which
  internally proxies to the capabilities exposed by monitoring application’s
  api layer.


== Packaging

The monitoring application should be treated as an add-on stack.

----
Note: This means that the corresponding code, templates, configurations and
      flows of monitoring stack need to be shipped separately, with assumption
      that the core stack is already started.
----

* sds-specific plugins and corresponding templates will be maintained as part
  of https://github.com/Tendrl/performance_monitoring[performance_monitoring]
  under a sds specific sub-package but it will be separately packaged as
  tendrl-sds-monitoring.
  ex: tendrl-gluster-monitoring and tendrl-ceph-monitoring
* Physical resource plugins and corresponding templates will be maintained as
  part of
  https://github.com/Tendrl/performance_monitoring[performance_monitoring]
  under sub-package node_monitoring and it will be packaged separately as
  tendrl-node-monitoring
* Alerting module will be maintained as part of separate repository
  https://github.com/Tendrl/alerting[alerting] and packaged separately as
  tendrl-alerting but installed along with tendrl core stack.
* Monitoring aggregator and monitoring api layer will be will be maintained as
  part of
  https://github.com/Tendrl/performance_monitoring[performance_monitoring] and
  packaged as tendrl-performance-monitoring
